# Contrastive Predictive Coding

Contrastive Predictive Coding, CPC, is an autoregressive model combined with InfoNCE loss[^Oord2018].


!!! note "Predictive Coding"

    As a related topic, predictive coding is a different scheme than backpropagation. Predictive coding updates the weights using local updating rules only[@Millidge2020-mr].


There are two key ideas in CPC:

- Autoregressive models in latent space, and
- InfoNCE loss that combines mutual information and NCE.

For the series of segments, $\{x_t\}$, we apply an encoder on each segment, and calculate the latent space, $\{{\color{blue}\hat x_t}\}$. The latent space $\{{\color{blue}\hat x_t}\}$ is then modeled using an autoregressive model to calculate the coding, $\{{\color{red}c_t}\}$.

The loss is built on NCE to estimate the lower bound of mutual information,

$$
\mathcal L = -\mathbb E_X \left[ \log \frac{f_k(x_{t+k}, c_t)}{\sum_{j} f_k(x_{j}, c_t) } \right],
$$

where $f_k(x_{x+i}, c_t)$ is estimated using a log-bilinear model, $f_k(x_{x+i}, c_t) = \exp\left( z_{t+i} W_i c_t \right)$. This is also a cross entropy loss.

Minimizing $\mathcal L$ leads to a $f_k$ that estimates the ratio[^Oord2018]

$$
\frac{p(x_{t+k}\mid c_t)}{p(x_{t+k})} = \frac{p(x_{t+k}, c_t)}{p(x_{t+k})p(c_t)}.
$$

We can perform downstream tasks such as classifications using the encoders.

!!! warning "Maximizing this lower bound?"
    This so-called lower bound for mutual information in this case is not always going to work[^Newell2020]. In some cases, the representations learned using this lower bound doesn't help or even worsen the performance of downstream tasks.
