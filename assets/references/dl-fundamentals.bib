                 last decade. However, its deficiencies of dependence on
                 manual labels and vulnerability to attacks have driven
                 people to explore a better solution. As an alternative,
                 self-supervised learning attracts many researchers for its
                 soaring performance on representation learning in the last
                 several years. Self-supervised representation learning
                 leverages input data itself as supervision and benefits
                 almost all types of downstream tasks. In this survey, we
                 take a look into new self-supervised learning methods for
                 representation in computer vision, natural language
                 processing, and graph learning. We comprehensively review
                 the existing empirical methods and summarize them into three
                 main categories according to their objectives: generative,
                 contrastive, and generative-contrastive (adversarial). We
                 further investigate related theoretical analysis work to
                 provide deeper thoughts on how self-supervised learning
                 works. Finally, we briefly discuss open problems and future
                 directions for self-supervised learning. An outline slide

                   Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers,

                   neural network. The output of the network is computed using
                   a black-box differential equation solver. These

                   demystify, and unify the understanding of diffusion models
                   across both variational and score-based perspectives. We
                   first derive Variational Diffusion Models (VDM) as a special
                   case of a Markovian Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder,
                   where three key assumptions enable tractable computation and
                   scalable optimization of the ELBO. We then prove that
                   optimizing a VDM boils down to learning a neural network to
                   predict one of three potential objectives: the original
                   source input from any arbitrary noisification of it, the
                   original source noise from any arbitrarily noisified input,
                   or the score function of a noisified input at any arbitrary

                   the score function, and connect the variational perspective
                   of a diffusion model explicitly with the Score-based
                   Generative Modeling perspective through Tweedie's Formula.

                   computationally tractable. Here, we develop an approach that
                   simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability.
                   The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical
                   physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure
                   in a data distribution through an iterative forward

              Demmel, James | Abstract: Due to the prevalence of machine
              learning algorithms and the potential for their decisions to
              profoundly impact billions of human lives, it is crucial that
              they are robust, reliable, and understandable. This thesis
              examines key theoretical pillars of machine learning surrounding
              generalization and overfitting, and tests the extent to which
              empirical behavior matches existing theory. We develop novel
              methods for measuring overfitting and generalization, and we
              characterize how reproducible observed behavior is across
              differences in optimization algorithm, dataset, task, evaluation
              metric, and domain.First, we examine how optimization algorithms
              bias machine learning models towards solutions with varying
              generalization properties. We show that adaptive gradient methods
              empirically find solutions with inferior generalization behavior
              compared to those found by stochastic gradient descent. We then
              construct an example using a simple overparameterized model that
              corroborates the algorithms' empirical behavior on neural
              networks. Next, we study the extent to which machine learning
              models have overfit to commonly reused datasets in both academic
              benchmarks and machine learning competitions. We build new test
              sets for the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and evaluate a broad
              range of classification models on the new datasets. All models
              experience a drop in accuracy, which indicates that current
              accuracy numbers are susceptible to even minute natural
              variations in the data distribution. Surprisingly, despite
              several years of adaptively selecting the models to perform well
              on these competitive benchmarks, we find no evidence of
              overfitting. We then analyze data from the machine learning
              platform Kaggle and find little evidence of substantial
              overfitting in ML competitions. These findings speak to the
              robustness of the holdout method across different data domains,
              loss functions, model classes, and human analysts.Overall, our
              work suggests that the true concern for robust machine learning
              is distribution shift rather than overfitting, and designing
              models that still work reliably in dynamic environments is a
              challenging but necessary undertaking.",

  abstract  = "During the past decade there has been an explosion in
               computation and information technology. With it have come vast
               amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine,
               biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding
               these data has led to the development of new tools in the field
               of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,
               machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have
               common underpinnings but are often expressed with different
               terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these
               areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is
               statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than
               mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of
               color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and
               anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The
               book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction)
               to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural
               networks, support vector machines, classification trees and
               boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in
               any book. This major new edition features many topics not
               covered in the original, including graphical models, random
               forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path
               algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and
               spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for
               ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and
               false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and
               Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford
               University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie
               and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a
               popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the
               statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and
               invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the
               lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to
               the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining
               tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient
               boosting.",

                   present a residual learning framework to ease the training of
                   networks that are substantially deeper than those used
                   previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning
                   residual functions with reference to the layer inputs,
                   instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide
                   comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual
                   networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from
                   considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we
                   evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x
                   deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An
                   ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the
                   ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the
                   ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on
                   CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of
                   representations is of central importance for many visual
                   recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep
                   representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the

                   led to significant reductions in error on competitive
                   benchmarks. Although the unmatched expressiveness of the many
                   layers can be highly desirable at test time, training very
                   deep networks comes with its own set of challenges. The
                   gradients can vanish, the forward flow often diminishes, and
                   the training time can be painfully slow. To address these
                   problems, we propose stochastic depth, a training procedure
                   that enables the seemingly contradictory setup to train short
                   networks and use deep networks at test time. We start with
                   very deep networks but during training, for each mini-batch,
                   randomly drop a subset of layers and bypass them with the
                   identity function. This simple approach complements the
                   recent success of residual networks. It reduces training time
                   substantially and improves the test error significantly on
                   almost all data sets that we used for evaluation. With
                   stochastic depth we can increase the depth of residual
                   networks even beyond 1200 layers and still yield meaningful
                   improvements in test error (4.91\% on CIFAR-10).",

               of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review
               Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by
               introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long
               short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does
               not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess
               of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow
               through constant error carousels within special units.
               Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the
               constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its
               computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our
               experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed,
               real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons
               with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time,
               recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence
               chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns
               much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag
               tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network
