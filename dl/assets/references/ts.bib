abstract      = "Deep learning performs remarkably well on many time series
                 analysis tasks recently. The superior performance of deep
                 neural networks relies heavily on a large number of training
                 data to avoid overfitting. However, the labeled data of many
                 real-world time series applications may be limited such as
                 classification in medical time series and anomaly detection
                 in AIOps. As an effective way to enhance the size and
                 quality of the training data, data augmentation is crucial
                 to the successful application of deep learning models on
                 time series data. In this paper, we systematically review
                 different data augmentation methods for time series. We
                 propose a taxonomy for the reviewed methods, and then
                 provide a structured review for these methods by
                 highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also
                 empirically compare different data augmentation methods for
                 different tasks including time series classification,
                 anomaly detection, and forecasting. Finally, we discuss and
                 highlight five future directions to provide useful research
                 guidance.",
