                 neural networks relies heavily on a large number of training
                 data to avoid overfitting. However, the labeled data of many

                 classification in medical time series and anomaly detection
                 in AIOps. As an effective way to enhance the size and

  abstract  = "Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably
               well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are
               heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting
               refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with
               very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data.
               Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to
               big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on
               Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of
               limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of
               techniques that enhance the size and quality of training
               datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built
               using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this
               survey include geometric transformations, color space
               augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing,
               feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative
               adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning.
               The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are
               heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation
               techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other
               characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time
               augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and
               curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods
               for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level
               decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will
               understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of
               their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of
               the capabilities of big data.",

  abstract      = "One of the most important tasks in network management is
                   identifying different types of traffic flows. As a result, a
                   type of management service, called Network Traffic
                   Classifier (NTC), has been introduced. One type of NTCs that
                   has gained huge attention in recent years applies deep
                   learning on packets in order to classify flows. Internet is
                   an imbalanced environment i.e., some classes of applications
                   are a lot more populated than others e.g., HTTP.
                   Additionally, one of the challenges in deep learning methods
                   is that they do not perform well in imbalanced environments
                   in terms of evaluation metrics such as precision, recall,
                   and $\mathrm\{F_1\}$ measure. In order to solve this
                   problem, we recommend the use of augmentation methods to
                   balance the dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel data
                   augmentation approach based on the use of Long Short Term
                   Memory (LSTM) networks for generating traffic flow patterns
                   and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for replicating the
                   numerical features of each class. First, we use the LSTM
                   network in order to learn and generate the sequence of
                   packets in a flow for classes with less population. Then, we
                   complete the features of the sequence with generating random
                   values based on the distribution of a certain feature, which
                   will be estimated using KDE. Finally, we compare the
                   training of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN)
                   in large-scale imbalanced, sampled, and augmented datasets.
                   The contribution of our augmentation scheme is then
                   evaluated on all of the datasets through measurements of
                   precision, recall, and F1 measure for every class of
                   application. The results demonstrate that our scheme is well
                   suited for network traffic flow datasets and improves the
                   performance of deep learning algorithms when it comes to
                   above-mentioned metrics.",

                   increase generalization. However, in the field of time

                   decomposition and convolutional neural network for time

                   effectively handle complicated patterns in time series, and
                   meanwhile significantly simplifies the architecture of the
                   neural network, which is an encoder-decoder architecture

                   is very useful in anomaly detection. Due to the limited

                   audio events may be produced by a wide variety of sources.
                   Furthermore, distinguishing them often requires analyzing an
                   extended time period due to the lack of clear sub-word units
                   that are present in speech. In order to incorporate this
                   long-time frequency structure of audio events, we introduce
                   a convolutional neural network (CNN) operating on a large
                   temporal input. In contrast to previous works this allows us
                   to train an audio event detection system end-to-end. The

                   augmentation outperforms previous methods for audio event

              modeling high-dimensional time-series with limited number of
              instances in the minority positive class. In addition, the
              computational complexity for learning the model is only of the
              order O(Ln+d(2)) where n+ is the number of positively labeled
              samples. We conduct extensive classification experiments based on
              several well-known time-series data sets (both single- and
              multimodal) by first randomly generating synthetic instances from
              our learned mixture model to correct the imbalance. We then
              compare our results with several state-of-the-art oversampling
              techniques and the results demonstrate that when our proposed
              model is used in oversampling, the same support vector machines
              classifier achieves much better classification accuracy across
              the range of data sets. In fact, the proposed method achieves the
              best average performance 30 times out of 36 multimodal data sets
              according to the F-value metric. Our results are also highly
              competitive compared with nonoversampling-based classifiers for
              dealing with imbalanced time-series data sets.",

               (bagging) of exponential smoothing methods, which results in
               significant improvements in the forecasts. The bagging uses a
               Box--Cox transformation followed by an STL decomposition to
               separate the time series into the trend, seasonal part, and
               remainder. The remainder is then bootstrapped using a moving
               block bootstrap, and a new series is assembled using this
               bootstrapped remainder. An ensemble of exponential smoothing
               models is then estimated on the bootstrapped series, and the
               resulting point forecasts are combined. We evaluate this new
               method on the M3 data set, and show that it outperforms the
               original exponential smoothing models consistently. On the

              Pierre",
  abstract = "Mining sequential data is an old topic that has been revived in
              the last decade, due to the increasing availability of sequential
              datasets. Most works in this field are centred on the definition
              and use of a distance (or, at least, a similarity measure)
              between sequences of elements. A measure called dynamic time
              warping (DTW) seems to be currently the most relevant for a large
              panel of applications. This article is about the use of DTW in
              data mining algorithms, and focuses on the computation of an
              average of a set of sequences. Averaging is an essential tool for
              the analysis of data. For example, the K-means clustering
              algorithm repeatedly computes such an average, and needs to
              provide a description of the clusters it forms. Averaging is here
              a crucial step, which must be sound in order to make algorithms
              work accurately. When dealing with sequences, especially when
              sequences are compared with DTW, averaging is not a trivial task.
              Starting with existing techniques developed around DTW, the
              article suggests an analysis framework to classify averaging
              techniques. It then proceeds to study the two major questions
              lifted by the framework. First, we develop a global technique for
              averaging a set of sequences. This technique is original in that
              it avoids using iterative pairwise averaging. It is thus
              insensitive to ordering effects. Second, we describe a new
              strategy to reduce the length of the resulting average sequence.
              This has a favourable impact on performance, but also on the
              relevance of the results. Both aspects are evaluated on standard
              datasets, and the evaluation shows that they compare favourably
              with existing methods. The article ends by describing the use of
              averaging in clustering. The last section also introduces a new
              application domain, namely the analysis of satellite image time
              series, where data mining techniques provide an original
              approach.",

                   real-world applications, outperforming many state-of-the-art
                   univariate forecasting techniques. In most cases, GFMs are
                   implemented using deep neural networks, and in particular
                   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which require a sufficient
                   amount of time series to estimate their numerous model
                   parameters. However, many time series databases have only a
                   limited number of time series. In this study, we propose a
                   novel, data augmentation based forecasting framework that is
                   capable of improving the baseline accuracy of the GFM models
                   in less data-abundant settings. We use three time series

                   (MBB), and dynamic time warping barycentric averaging (DBA)

                   train a model on the augmented time series alongside the
                   original time series dataset, whereas in the transfer

               creating synthetic examples in order to augment a dataset used
               to learn a model. One motivation for data augmentation is to
               reduce the variance of a classifier, thereby reducing error. In
               this paper, we propose new data augmentation techniques
               specifically designed for time series classification, where the
               space in which they are embedded is induced by Dynamic Time
               Warping (DTW). The main idea of our approach is to average a set
               of time series and use the average time series as a new
               synthetic example. The proposed methods rely on an extension of
               DTW Barycentric Averaging (DBA), the averaging technique that is
               specifically developed for DTW. In this paper, we extend DBA to
               be able to calculate a weighted average of time series under
               DTW. In this case, instead of each time series contributing
               equally to the final average, some can contribute more than
               others. This extension allows us to generate an infinite number
               of new examples from any set of given time series. To this end,
               we propose three methods that choose the weights associated to
               the time series of the dataset. We carry out experiments on the
               85 datasets of the UCR archive and demonstrate that our method
               is particularly useful when the number of available examples is
               limited (e.g. 2 to 6 examples per class) using a 1-NN DTW
               classifier. Furthermore, we show that augmenting full datasets
               is beneficial in most cases, as we observed an increase of
               accuracy on 56 datasets, no effect on 7 and a slight decrease on

                   image and video manipulation, especially generation, making
                   significant advancements. While these computer vision
                   advances have garnered much attention, GAN applications have
                   diversified across disciplines such as time series and
                   sequence generation. As a relatively new niche for GANs,
                   fieldwork is ongoing to develop high quality, diverse and
                   private time series data. In this paper, we review GAN
                   variants designed for time series related applications. We
                   propose a taxonomy of discrete-variant GANs and
                   continuous-variant GANs, in which GANs deal with discrete

                   increasingly replacing traditional methods in many domains
                   involved with important decision making activities. DL
                   techniques tailor-made for specific tasks such as image
                   recognition, signal processing, or speech analysis are being
                   introduced at a fast pace with many improvements. However,
                   for the domain of forecasting, the current state in the ML
                   community is perhaps where other domains such as Natural
                   Language Processing and Computer Vision were at several
                   years ago. The field of forecasting has mainly been fostered
                   by statisticians/econometricians; consequently the related
                   concepts are not the mainstream knowledge among general ML
                   practitioners. The different non-stationarities associated
                   with time series challenge the data-driven ML models.
                   Nevertheless, recent trends in the domain have shown that
                   with the availability of massive amounts of time series, ML
                   techniques are quite competent in forecasting, when related
                   pitfalls are properly handled. Therefore, in this work we
                   provide a tutorial-like compilation of the details of one of
                   the most important steps in the overall forecasting process,
                   namely the evaluation. This way, we intend to impart the
                   information of forecast evaluation to fit the context of ML,
                   as means of bridging the knowledge gap between traditional
                   methods of forecasting and state-of-the-art ML techniques.
                   We elaborate on the different problematic characteristics of
                   time series such as non-normalities and non-stationarities
                   and how they are associated with common pitfalls in forecast
                   evaluation. Best practices in forecast evaluation are
                   outlined with respect to the different steps such as data
                   partitioning, error calculation, statistical testing, and

                   recognition and part of their success is due to
                   generalization from using large datasets. However, unlike
                   other domains, time series classification datasets are often
                   small. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel
                   time series data augmentation called guided warping. While
                   many data augmentation methods are based on random
                   transformations, guided warping exploits the element
                   alignment properties of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and
                   shapeDTW, a high-level DTW method based on shape
                   descriptors, to deterministically warp sample patterns. In
                   this way, the time series are mixed by warping the features
                   of a sample pattern to match the time steps of a reference
                   pattern. Furthermore, we introduce a discriminative teacher
                   in order to serve as a directed reference for the guided
                   warping. We evaluate the method on all 85 datasets in the
                   2015 UCR Time Series Archive with a deep convolutional
                   neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN).
