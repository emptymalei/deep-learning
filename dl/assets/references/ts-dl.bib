abstract      = "Time series forecasting is a crucial task in machine
                 learning, as it has a wide range of applications including
                 but not limited to forecasting electricity consumption,
                 traffic, and air quality. Traditional forecasting models
                 rely on rolling averages, vector auto-regression and
                 auto-regressive integrated moving averages. On the other
                 hand, deep learning and matrix factorization models have
                 been recently proposed to tackle the same problem with more
                 competitive performance. However, one major drawback of such
                 models is that they tend to be overly complex in comparison
                 to traditional techniques. In this paper, we report the
                 results of prominent deep learning models with respect to a
                 well-known machine learning baseline, a Gradient Boosting
                 Regression Tree (GBRT) model. Similar to the deep neural
                 network (DNN) models, we transform the time series
                 forecasting task into a window-based regression problem.
                 Furthermore, we feature-engineered the input and output
                 structure of the GBRT model, such that, for each training
                 window, the target values are concatenated with external
                 features, and then flattened to form one input instance for
                 a multi-output GBRT model. We conducted a comparative study
                 on nine datasets for eight state-of-the-art deep-learning
                 models that were presented at top-level conferences in the
                 last years. The results demonstrate that the window-based
                 input transformation boosts the performance of a simple GBRT
                 model to levels that outperform all state-of-the-art DNN
                 models evaluated in this paper.",

  abstract      = "While deep learning has enabled tremendous progress on text
                   and image datasets, its superiority on tabular data is not
                   clear. We contribute extensive benchmarks of standard and
                   novel deep learning methods as well as tree-based models
                   such as XGBoost and Random Forests, across a large number of
                   datasets and hyperparameter combinations. We define a
                   standard set of 45 datasets from varied domains with clear
                   characteristics of tabular data and a benchmarking
                   methodology accounting for both fitting models and finding
                   good hyperparameters. Results show that tree-based models
                   remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data ($\sim$10K
                   samples) even without accounting for their superior speed.
                   To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical
                   investigation into the differing inductive biases of
                   tree-based models and Neural Networks (NNs). This leads to a
                   series of challenges which should guide researchers aiming
                   to build tabular-specific NNs: 1. be robust to uninformative
                   features, 2. preserve the orientation of the data, and 3. be
                   able to easily learn irregular functions. To stimulate
                   research on tabular architectures, we contribute a standard
                   benchmark and raw data for baselines: every point of a 20
