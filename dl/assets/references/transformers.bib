  abstract      = "Recently, there has been a surge of Transformer-based
                   solutions for the long-term time series forecasting (LTSF)
                   task. Despite the growing performance over the past few
                   years, we question the validity of this line of research in
                   this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most
                   successful solution to extract the semantic correlations
                   among the elements in a long sequence. However, in time
                   series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in
                   an ordered set of continuous points. While employing
                   positional encoding and using tokens to embed sub-series in
                   Transformers facilitate preserving some ordering
                   information, the nature of the
                   \textbackslashemph\{permutation-invariant\} self-attention
                   mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss.
                   To validate our claim, we introduce a set of embarrassingly
                   simple one-layer linear models named LTSF-Linear for
                   comparison. Experimental results on nine real-life datasets
                   show that LTSF-Linear surprisingly outperforms existing
                   sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models in all cases,
                   and often by a large margin. Moreover, we conduct
                   comprehensive empirical studies to explore the impacts of
                   various design elements of LTSF models on their temporal
                   relation extraction capability. We hope this surprising
                   finding opens up new research directions for the LTSF task.
                   We also advocate revisiting the validity of
                   Transformer-based solutions for other time series analysis
                   tasks (e.g., anomaly detection) in the future. Code is

                   applications, such as extreme weather early warning and
                   long-term energy consumption planning. This paper studies the
                   long-term forecasting problem of time series. Prior
                   Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention
                   mechanisms to discover the long-range dependencies. However,
                   intricate temporal patterns of the long-term future prohibit
                   the model from finding reliable dependencies. Also,
                   Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise
                   self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the
                   information utilization bottleneck. Going beyond
                   Transformers, we design Autoformer as a novel decomposition
                   architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break
                   with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition
                   and renovate it as a basic inner block of deep models. This
                   design empowers Autoformer with progressive decomposition
                   capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired by the
                   stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation
                   mechanism based on the series periodicity, which conducts the
                   dependencies discovery and representation aggregation at the
                   sub-series level. Auto-Correlation outperforms self-attention
                   in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term forecasting,

                   sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption
                   planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF)
                   demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the
                   ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling
                   between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have
                   shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction
                   capacity. However, there are several severe issues with
                   Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to
                   LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage,
                   and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture.
                   To address these issues, we design an efficient
                   transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three
                   distinctive characteristics: (i) a $ProbSparse$
                   self-attention mechanism, which achieves $O(L \log L)$ in
                   time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable
                   performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the
                   self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by
                   halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles
                   extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style
                   decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long
                   time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a
                   step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference
                   speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on

                   prior information on how they interact with the target. While
                   several deep learning models have been proposed for
                   multi-step prediction, they typically comprise black-box
                   models which do not account for the full range of inputs
                   present in common scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the
                   Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) -- a novel attention-based
                   architecture which combines high-performance multi-horizon
                   forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal
                   dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different
                   scales, the TFT utilizes recurrent layers for local
                   processing and interpretable self-attention layers for
                   learning long-term dependencies. The TFT also uses
                   specialized components for the judicious selection of
                   relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress
                   unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide
                   range of regimes. On a variety of real-world datasets, we
                   demonstrate significant performance improvements over
                   existing benchmarks, and showcase three practical
                   interpretability use-cases of TFT.",

                   for multivariate time series forecasting and self-supervised
                   representation learning. It is based on two key components:
                   (i) segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches
                   which are served as input tokens to Transformer; (ii)
                   channel-independence where each channel contains a single
                   univariate time series that shares the same embedding and
                   Transformer weights across all the series. Patching design
                   naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic information
                   is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of
                   the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same
                   look-back window; and the model can attend longer history.
                   Our channel-independent patch time series Transformer
                   (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy

                   improved state-of-the-art results for long-term series
                   forecasting, they are not only computationally expensive but
                   more importantly, are unable to capture the global view of
                   time series (e.g. overall trend). To address these problems,
                   we propose to combine Transformer with the seasonal-trend
                   decomposition method, in which the decomposition method
                   captures the global profile of time series while Transformers
                   capture more detailed structures. To further enhance the
                   performance of Transformer for long-term prediction, we
                   exploit the fact that most time series tend to have a sparse
                   representation in well-known basis such as Fourier transform,
                   and develop a frequency enhanced Transformer. Besides being
                   more effective, the proposed method, termed as Frequency
                   Enhanced Decomposed Transformer ({\bf FEDformer}), is more

                   to the sequence length. Our empirical studies with six

                   Transformer-based forecasters. These forecasters leverage
                   Transformers to model the global dependencies over temporal
                   tokens of time series, with each token formed by multiple
                   variates of the same timestamp. However, Transformer is
                   challenged in forecasting series with larger lookback windows
                   due to performance degradation and computation explosion.
                   Besides, the unified embedding for each temporal token fuses
                   multiple variates with potentially unaligned timestamps and
                   distinct physical measurements, which may fail in learning
                   variate-centric representations and result in meaningless
                   attention maps. In this work, we reflect on the competent
                   duties of Transformer components and repurpose the
                   Transformer architecture without any adaptation on the basic
                   components. We propose iTransformer that simply inverts the
                   duties of the attention mechanism and the feed-forward
                   network. Specifically, the time points of individual series
                   are embedded into variate tokens which are utilized by the
                   attention mechanism to capture multivariate correlations;
                   meanwhile, the feed-forward network is applied for each
                   variate token to learn nonlinear representations. The
                   iTransformer model achieves consistent state-of-the-art on
                   several real-world datasets, which further empowers the
                   Transformer family with promoted performance, generalization
                   ability across different variates, and better utilization of
                   arbitrary lookback windows, making it a nice alternative as
                   the fundamental backbone of time series forecasting.",
