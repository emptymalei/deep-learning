  abstract = "Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that
              each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled
              independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the
              forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a
              limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The
              generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on
              the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the
              correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to
              split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to
              Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings
              of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but
              are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor
              error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the
              response to increasing the number of features used in the
              splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable
              importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

  abstract  = "Decision trees are attractive classifiers due to their high
               execution speed. But trees derived with traditional methods
               often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss
               of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on
               complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data.
               Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a
               method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be
               arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training
               and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple
               trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees
               in, different subspaces generalize their classification in
               complementary ways, and their combined classification can be
               monotonically improved. The validity of the method is
               demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of
               handwritten digits.",

  abstract = "Random forests are a scheme proposed by Leo Breiman in the 2000's
              for building a predictor ensemble with a set of decision trees
              that grow in randomly selected subspaces of data. Despite growing
              interest and practical use, there has been little exploration of
              the statistical properties of random forests, and little is known
              about the mathematical forces driving the algorithm. In this
              paper, we offer an in-depth analysis of a random forests model
              suggested by Breiman (2004), which is very close to the original
              algorithm. We show in particular that the procedure is consistent
              and adapts to sparsity, in the sense that its rate of convergence
              depends only on the number of strong features and not on how many
              noise variables are present.",

                   ensemble learning algorithm widely used across a variety of
                   applications. Recently, several variants of GBDT training
                   algorithms and implementations have been designed and
                   heavily optimized in some very popular open sourced toolkits
                   including XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost. In this paper, we
                   show that both the accuracy and efficiency of GBDT can be
                   further enhanced by using more complex base learners.
                   Specifically, we extend gradient boosting to use piecewise
                   linear regression trees (PL Trees), instead of piecewise
                   constant regression trees, as base learners. We show that PL
                   Trees can accelerate convergence of GBDT and improve the
                   accuracy. We also propose some optimization tricks to
                   substantially reduce the training time of PL Trees, with
                   little sacrifice of accuracy. Moreover, we propose several
                   implementation techniques to speedup our algorithm on modern
                   computer architectures with powerful Single Instruction
                   Multiple Data (SIMD) parallelism. The experimental results
                   show that GBDT with PL Trees can provide very competitive
                   testing accuracy with comparable or less training time.",
