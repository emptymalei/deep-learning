abstract      = "Deep supervised learning has achieved great success in the
                 last decade. However, its deficiencies of dependence on
                 manual labels and vulnerability to attacks have driven
                 people to explore a better solution. As an alternative,
                 self-supervised learning attracts many researchers for its
                 soaring performance on representation learning in the last
                 several years. Self-supervised representation learning
                 leverages input data itself as supervision and benefits
                 almost all types of downstream tasks. In this survey, we
                 take a look into new self-supervised learning methods for
                 representation in computer vision, natural language
                 processing, and graph learning. We comprehensively review
                 the existing empirical methods and summarize them into three
                 main categories according to their objectives: generative,
                 contrastive, and generative-contrastive (adversarial). We
                 further investigate related theoretical analysis work to
                 provide deeper thoughts on how self-supervised learning
                 works. Finally, we briefly discuss open problems and future
                 directions for self-supervised learning. An outline slide
                 for the survey is provided.",
