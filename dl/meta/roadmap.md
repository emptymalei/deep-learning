# Roadmap


When I switched to data science, I built [my digital garden, datumorphism](https://datumorphism.leima.is/). I deliberately designed this digital garden as my second brain. As a result, most of the articles are fragments of knowledge and require context to understand them.

Making bricks is easy but assembling them into a house is not easy. So I have decided to use this repository to practice my house-building techniques.

I do not have a finished blueprint yet. But I have a framework in my mind: I want to consolidate some of my thoughts and learnings in an organized way. However, I do not want to compile a reference book, as [datumorphism](https://datumorphism.leima.is/) already serves this purpose. I am thinking of an

## :material-open-source-initiative: Open Source

This is an open-source project on GitHub: [:fontawesome-brands-github-alt: emptymalei/deep-learning](https://github.com/emptymalei/deep-learning).


## :material-language-markdown: How Do I Write It

I am trying out a more "agile" method. Instead of finishing the whole project at once, I will release the book by chapter. A few thoughts on this plan:

- Each new section should be a PR.
- Every PR is reviewed.
- Release on every new section.
