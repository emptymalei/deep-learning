# Time Series Data and Statistical Forecasting Mothods


## Time Series Data

Time series data comes from a variety of data generating processes. There are also different formulations and views of time series data.

Time series data can be formulated as a sequence of vector functions of time [@Dorffner1996-rd]. There are many different types of tasks on time series data, for example,

- classification,
- anomaly detection, and
- forecasting.

In this chapter, we focus on the forecasting problem.

## The Forecasting Problem

To make it easier to formulate the forecasting problem, we group the time series features based on the role they play in a forecasting problem. Given a dataset $\mathcal D$, with

1. $y^{(i)}_t$, the sequential variable to be forecasted,
2. $x^{(i)}_t$, exogenous data for the time series data,
3. $u^{(i)}_t$, some features that can be obtained or planned in advance,

where ${}^{(i)}$ indicates the $i$th variable, ${}_ t$ denotes time. In a forecasting task, we use $y^{(i)} _ {t-K:t}$, $x^{(i) _ {t-K:t}}$, and $u^{(i)} _ {t-K:t+H}$, to forecast the future $y^{(i)} _ {t+1:t+H}$. In these notations, $K$ is the input sequence length and $H$ is the forecast horizon.

A forecasting model $f$ will use $x^{(i)} _ {t-K:t}$ and $u^{(i)} _ {t-K:t+H}$ to forecast $y^{(i)} _ {t+1:t+H}$.

In the section [Time Series Forecasting Tasks](timeseries-forecast.tasks.md), we will discuss more details of the forecasting problem.


## Categories of Forecasting Methods

[Januschowsk et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301529) proposed a framework to classify the different forecasting methods[@Januschowski2020-ys]. We illustrate the different methods in the following charts. For simplicity, we simply merge all the possible dimensions in one chart.

We will mention those different dimensions later in our discussion of different forecasting models. For example, random forest is an ensemble method, which we will discuss in detail later.
