# Time Series Data Generating Process: Langevin Equation

Among the many data generating processes (DGP), Langevin equation is one of the most interesting DGP.

## Brownian Motion

Brownian motion as a very simple stochastic process can be described by the Langevin equation[^ma-sp]. In this section, we simulate a time series from Brownian motion.

Macroscopically, Brownian Motion can be described by the notion of random forces on the particles,

$$
\frac{d}{dt} v(t) + \gamma v(t) = R(t),
$$

where $v(t)$ is the velocity at time $t$ and $R(t)$ is the stochastic force density from the reservoir particles. Solving the equation, we get

$$
v(t) = v(0)e^{-\gamma t} + \int_0^t dt' e^{-\gamma (t-t')} R(t') .
$$

To generate a dataset numerically, we discretize it by replacing the integral with a sum,

$$
v(t) = v(0) e^{-\gamma t} + \sum_{n=0}^N \Delta t e^{-\gamma (t - t_n)} R(t_n)
$$

where $t_i = i * \Delta t$ and $t = t_n$, thus the equation is further simplified,

$$
v(N\Delta t) = v(0) e^{-\gamma N\Delta t} + \sum_{n=0}^N  e^{-\gamma (N - n)\Delta t} R(n\Delta t) \Delta t.
$$
