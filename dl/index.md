# Introduction


When I switched to data science, I built [my digital garden, datumorphism](https://datumorphism.leima.is/). I deliberately designed this digital garden as my second brain. As a result, most of the articles are fragments of knowledge and require context to understand them.

Making bricks is easy but assembling them into a house is not easy. So I have decided to use this repository to practice my house-building techniques.

I do not have a finished blueprint yet. But I have a framework in my mind: I want to consolidate some of my thoughts and learnings in a good way. However, I do not want to compile a reference book, as [datumorphism](https://datumorphism.leima.is/) already serves this purpose. I should create stories.
