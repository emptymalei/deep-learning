# Tech Onboarding

In this book, we focus on python-based deep learning projects. In the main chapters, we will focus on the theories and actual code. Thus all the tech stack related topics are shoved into this chapter as references.

!!! info

    This chapter is not aiming to be a comprehensive note on these technologies but a few key components that may be missing in many research oriented data science tech stacks. We assume the readers have worked with the essential technologies in a python-based deep learning project.
