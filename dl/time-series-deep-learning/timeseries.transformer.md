# Transformers for Time Series Forecasting

[Transformer](../transformers/transformers.vanilla.md) is a good candidate for time series forecasting due to its sequence modeling capability. In this section, we will introduce some basic ideas of transformer-based models for time series forecasting.

## Transformer for Univariate Time Series Forecasting

We take a simple [Univariate time series forecasting](../time-series/timeseries-forecast.tasks.md) task as an example.
