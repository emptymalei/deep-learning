# Time Series Forecasting with Deep Learning

In the chapter [Deep Learning Fundamentals](../deep-learning-fundamentals), we discussed some deep learning models. In this chapter, we will discuss how to apply deep learning models to time series forecasting problems.

## Creating Dataset for Deep Learning Models

Deep learning models usually require batches of data to train. For time series data, we need to slice along the time axis to create batches. In section [The Time Delay Embedding Representation](../time-series/timeseries-data.time-delayed-embedding/), we discussed methods to represent time series data.
